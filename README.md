# 🔐 Password Generator using Python

## 📌 Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a **Password Generator** using Python that can generate strong, random, and secure passwords. The password should be composed of a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to ensure maximum security. 

This project was developed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program – Level 1 Task** to demonstrate understanding of basic Python concepts such as string manipulation, loops, randomization, and user-defined functions.

## 🛠 Features

- Generates random passwords of user-defined length
- Uses uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- Ensures better password security and randomness
- Simple and easy-to-use logic using built-in Python modules

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `random` module
- `string` module

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. User specifies the desired password length.
2. The script combines all possible character types.
3. It randomly selects characters from this pool to form a password.
4. The final password is printed to the console.
